# Text Summarization Tool

## Overview
This Text Summarization Tool uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate concise summaries of large texts. It implements two types of summarization techniques:

1. **Extractive Summarization**: Selects important sentences directly from the original text.
2. **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates a new summary by paraphrasing the input text, offering a more human-like summary.

This project demonstrates the power of NLP for summarizing long-form content into shorter, more digestible versions while preserving the most important information.

## Key Features
- **Extractive Summarization**: Uses TF-IDF and SpaCy to identify and rank important sentences.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Uses the Hugging Face's BART model to generate human-like summaries.
- **Easy-to-use**: Input any text to receive both extractive and abstractive summaries.
- **Scalable**: Can be used for different sizes of input text, from articles to research papers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used to implement the tool.
- **SpaCy**: NLP library used for sentence tokenization and text processing.
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Used for ranking sentences in extractive summarization.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face library for working with pre-trained models like BART for abstractive summarization.

## Installation
To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanvi2828/text-summarization-tool.git
   cd text-summarization-tool
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install SpaCy’s English model:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

4. Install Hugging Face's Transformers library:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers
   ```

## How to Use

1. Simply input the text into the script, and the tool will provide both **extractive** and **abstractive** summaries.
2. Example usage:
   ```python
   sample_text = """
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live and work. 
   With applications ranging from healthcare to finance, AI-powered tools 
   are making life easier and businesses more efficient. Despite the hype, 
   it also raises ethical concerns and challenges related to job displacement 
   and decision-making transparency. Governments and organizations must 
   address these issues to ensure responsible AI development.
   """

   print(extractive_summary(sample_text))
   print(abstractive_summary(sample_text))
   ```

3. You’ll receive the following output:
   - **Extractive Summary**: Sentences directly picked from the text.
   - **Abstractive Summary**: A paraphrased, human-like summary.

## Example

**Input Text:**
```
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live and work. With applications ranging from healthcare to finance, AI-powered tools are making life easier and businesses more efficient. Despite the hype, it also raises ethical concerns and challenges related to job displacement and decision-making transparency. Governments and organizations must address these issues to ensure responsible AI development.
```

**Extractive Summary:**
```
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live and work. Despite the hype, it also raises ethical concerns and challenges related to job displacement and decision-making transparency.
```

**Abstractive Summary:**
```
AI is revolutionizing industries by improving efficiency and convenience, but ethical concerns and transparency challenges must be addressed for responsible growth.
```

## Future Improvements
- **Multiple Language Support**: Add support for summarizing text in languages other than English.
- **Customizable Summary Length**: Allow users to specify how long or short they want the summary to be.
- **User Interface**: Develop a simple web or desktop application for easier interaction.
